description: Show the DF Labs (Clio) tasks assigned to you — your plate. Live tasks first (doing, then todo), with their projects and how long each has been quiet. Use when the member asks "what's on my plate", "my clio tasks", "what am I on in DF", "tugasku di DF apa". Read-only.

# Your plate on Clio

```
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/clio.sh" mine
```

Print a tight list: `doing` first, then `todo`, then anything closed only if
asked. For each: id, title, project, and the last trail line's date if it is
old — a live task that has not moved in days is the one to ask about.

If they then want to say what they are on today, that is `checkin`; if they
want to say what happened on one of these, that is `report`. Do not blur the two.

<!-- AUTH: calls go through the plugin's script, which signs in the way every DF Labs plugin does: if ~/.config/dfos/token (or $DFOS_TOKEN) exists it is used as a terminal pass; otherwise it signs in at DF-OS once with the member's slug and DF-OS password (from ~/.config/dfos/{slug,pass} or $DFOS_PASSWORD, else asked) and keeps the session under ~/.config/dfos/ for 30 days, shared by every plugin. On a sign-in error, tell them to set ~/.config/dfos/slug and give their DF-OS password once; dfos defaults to https://os.dflabs.id. Never echo the password, the pass, or the cookie. -->
